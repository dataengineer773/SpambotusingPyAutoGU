PyAutoGUI is a Python module that helps us automate the key presses and mouse clicks programmatically. In this article we will learn to develop a spam bot using PyAutoGUI.
Spamming - Refers to sending unsolicited messages to large number of systems over the internet. 
This mini-project can be used for many real-life applications like:

    Remind your friends or relatives to do a particular task after every particular time interval
    Can be used for advertisement purpose

In this article we will show the working of spam bot on telegram, but the code can also work for WhatsApp, Instagram etc. i.e. anywhere we find a text field it will work the same way.Reminder: Drink water!...
